    <p>Painting is a visual art form that involves applying paint, pigment, color, or other mediums to a solid surface such as canvas, wood, or paper.<br> It is both the act of creating and the finished work itself, 
    capturing ideas, emotions, and aesthetic qualities in a two-dimensional visual language.</p>

    <h3><i>Ceramics</i></h3>
    <img src="painting.jpg" height="150" width="200" align="right" alt="Painting Art">
    <p>Small ceramics, often handcrafted, are valued for their unique characteristics that reflect the artist's touch.<br> These pieces frequently exhibit features like subtle glaze textures, uneven shapes, pinholes, black spots from the clay's natural minerals, and fine cracks called "crazing."<br> These elements add character and indicate the handmade nature of the ceramics, distinguishing them from mass-produced items.</p>
